# Summary of Wenting Li's projects


**A. Work during Internship at Inovision, Inc**

Part of my work at Inovision, Inc was written into two internship reports:

I also kept a 90-page work log, which kept track of all my work and tasks finished during the internship. The work log can be sent upon request. 

The techniques used include: .NET, MVC, SQL Server, C#, JavaScript, HTML, JQuery, CSS, BootStrap, Entity Framework Code First, etc.

**B. Tindog website**

This is a fun responsive website for dog lovers. Itâ€™s mobile-friendly. The main techniques used are: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap.

**C. Cupcake business website**

This is a business website allowing administrator to register, log in, view, and make changes.

**D. Web-based database system for managing social network**

This is a web-based database system for managing social network website. A user can register, log in, post blogs, follow/followed by others, like/dislike blogs, search people by id/username, etc. 

Apache Tomcat was used as the application server. All files (source codes, class files, bat, and txt) is contained in a war file. The project can be found here:

I made two demos of the social media application:

**E. Car Insurance Claim Forecasting Using Machine Learning Techniques**

In this project, machine learning techniques are explored to improve accuracy in classification prediction. Combined classification techniques are used to build a model that predicts the probability that a driver will initiate an auto insurance claim. Among these techniques, XGBoost outperforms all the other algorithms and gives best forecasting accuracy. 

The main techniques and languages used are: Python, R, Weka, Matlab

The project was written into a paper:

**F. Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning Techniques**

In this project, I tried various preprocessing methods and prediction techniques on WEKA. Several classification algorithms were used to build a model that predicts whether a patient has chronic kidney disease or not. The prediction results and performance of each algorithm is compared. The final prediction accuracy reaches 99%.
